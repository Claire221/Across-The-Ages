# Across the Ages

Across the Ages is an online e-commerse website that specilizes in all things 90's and 2000's

## App Purpose

View Website -

## UX

Because the website specializes in items from the 90's and 2000's I wanted the style of the website to reflect this. So throughout the website I used bold colours and patterns, I also styled the product cards after polaroid photos to give them a retro feel.

### Colour Scheme

The main colours scheme of the website is pink, blue, white with some green accents. I have used the same borders throughout the site to help make it feel more cohesive.

### Typography

Throughout the site I use two main fonts, one for the page titles and one for the rest of the text. For the title fonts I chose a more playful cursive font to capture the users attention and then for the main text I used a simple clean font so that it was easy to read.

### Wireframes

For the design of my app I used wireframes to visulize what I wanted each page to contain and a rough guide for how I wanted it to be laid out, this ensured that not only did I include all the features I wanted but also that i wasnt trying to design and create the website at the same time.
